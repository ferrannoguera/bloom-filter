This is the final assigment for the Algorithmics course from bachelor in informatics engineering. Coused in Barcelona school of informatics in polytechnic university of Catalonia (FIB - UPC).

## Information

Under the file `CyptoHash.pdf` there is all asked for this assigment and we did the final delivery in the `Documentació.pdf`.

## Usage

To be able to run the code and test everything explained in the final deliver, you should execute the following commands.

```bash
cd codi
./generaricomparar.sh  # Script responsible of compiling all code, create all the test cases and execute everything

Afterwards, under the `comparacions` directory there will be four subdirectories depending on the key size. In each of these subdirectories there will be the result of executing it with six test cases created randomly, as it is explained in the final delivery file.
